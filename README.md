# BabysitterKataSimplified
#This is a simplified version of the Babysitter Kata. I have been working on
#writing cleaner and simpler code. For this one, if the babysitter fee calculator
#is given a partial hour, the fee calculator will return 0. I also
#re-organized the test "Facts" into Theories. I added the .gitignore recommended
#by GitHub for Visual Studio because I got feedback that the .gitignore I had
#used previously was not doing a complete job.
